     * Language That Can be Executed Directly by the
     * Computer. Once the Source Code has been Compiled,
     * the Resulting Executable File Can be Run Repeatedly

     * the Program Line by Line, Translating each
     * Instruction into Machine Language and Immediately
     * Executing It. Interpreted Languages are Often Used
     * for Scripting and Rapid Prototyping Because They
     * Allow for Quick Iteration and Feedback During
     * Development.
